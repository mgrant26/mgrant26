## About Me

# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Michael Grant!Â Â 

Iâ€™m a **passionate software developer** driven by the pursuit of efficiency, scalability, and user-centric design. My expertise spans a diverse tech stack, but what truly defines me isnâ€™t just the tools I useâ€”itâ€™s the mindset I bring to every project.Â Â 

I thrive in **dynamic, fast-paced environments** where innovation and adaptability are key. Every line of code is an opportunity to refine, every challenge a chance to grow. To me, **there is no such thing as bad feedback, no wasted experience, no ideas without value**â€”only stepping stones toward mastery.Â Â 

### ðŸ’¡ My PhilosophyÂ Â 
I believe software development is more than just problem-solving; itâ€™s an art. Creativity fuels my approach, allowing me to build applications that are not only **functional** but also **intuitive** and **impactful**. I welcome all ideas, all perspectivesâ€”because the best solutions emerge from openness and iteration.Â Â 

### ðŸš€ What Drives MeÂ Â 
- **Continuous Learning:** Tech evolves, and so do I. Every project is a lesson. 
- **Innovation & Efficiency:** Writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code is my priority.Â Â 
- **Collaboration:** The best ideas come from working together. Open-source, mentorship, and feedback make us all better.Â Â 

Letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€Â Â

## Projects

### Project 1: [Functional Multiplayer Game](https://github.com/Group-9-ITSC4155-2024/club-cthulhu)
**Description:** Club Cthulhu is a collaborative software application or game developed for my ITSC 4155 class using Python, GDScript, the Godot Engine, and Git. The purpose of this project was to create a Club Penguin-like application with features including dynamic multiplayer and fully animated movements for each character.

### Project 2: [Hosted Meetup Application](https://github.com/mgrant26/ITIS4166-MG)
**Description:** This is a project that I completed for my ITSC 4166 class in which I created a functional meetup app, complete with login functionality and dynamic page creation based on my MongoDB database. Each page is capable of being edited by a signed-in user.

### Project 3: [Timecard/Rental Application](https://github.com/mgrant26/fmtennisapp)
**Description:** This is a project that I am working on for a Florida-based tennis club. I was sought out in April about this app, and am since working closely with the company to provide an app that lets users log in and reserve tennis courts, as well as make lessons for themselves with any of FM's hired trainers. They would also like to include the ability to let users buy their own merch. This application production has since been halted due to management.
