## Projects

### Project 1: [Functional Multiplayer Game](https://github.com/Group-9-ITSC4155-2024/club-cthulhu)
**Description:** Club Cthulhu is a collaborative software application or game developed for my ITSC 4155 class using Python, GDScript, the Godot Engine, and Git. The purpose of this project was to create a Club Penguin-like application with features including dynamic multiplayer and fully animated movements for each character.

### Project 2: [Hosted Meetup Application](https://github.com/mgrant26/ITIS4166-MG)
**Description:** This is a project that I completed for my ITSC 4166 class in which I created a functional meetup app, complete with login functionality and dynamic page creation based on my MongoDB database. Each page is capable of being edited by a signed-in user.

### Project 3: [Timecard/Rental Application](https://github.com/mgrant26/fmtennisapp)
**Description:** This is a project that I am working on for a Florida-based tennis club. I was sought out in April about this app, and am since working closely with the company to provide an app that lets users log in and reserve tennis courts, as well as make lessons for themselves with any of FM's hired trainers. They would also like to include the ability to let users buy their own merch. This application is still a work in progress.
